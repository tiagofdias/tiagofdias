<h2> 👩🏻‍💻 <b> Tiago Dias </b> </h2>

Hey there! I’m a 25-year-old Master's student in Computer Science living in Póvoa de Santa Iria, Lisbon, Portugal. I hold a Bachelor's degree in the same field and have picked up a bunch of skills along the way, including C#, SQL, OutSystems, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also became a certified Microsoft Office Specialist Master back in 2016, which has helped me navigate Office tools like a pro.

I’ve gained valuable experience through various internships, where I honed my problem-solving skills and learned a lot about software development. I’m always on the lookout for new challenges to grow my skills further.

I love working in fast-paced environments, whether solo or as part of a team. Building strong relationships with my colleagues and clients is important to me, and I’m always happy to share ideas and collaborate.
